Config Tutorial:
[main]
useConfig = False/True
threads = 1-100 (you can use more but it need more proxys and CPU/RAM
webhook = https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... Your discord webhook
miner = btc/ltc/eth (Only btc is working rn, we are working on the others)

[optional]
useProxy = False/True
proxyTimeout = 1-5 (I would recommend the default value)
showOnlyHits = False/True

-------------
I recommend you to use proxys and a webhook :)
Use Python 3.8.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/)
good luck!
